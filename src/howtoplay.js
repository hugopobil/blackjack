            you are trying to do is beat the dealer. \
            How do you beat the dealer? \
            By drawing a hand value that is higher than the dealerâ€™s hand value \
            By the dealer drawing a hand value that goes over 21. \
            By drawing a hand value of 21 on your first two cards, when the dealer does not. \
            How do you lose to the dealer? \
            Your hand value exceeds 21. \
            The dealer's hand has a greater value than yours at the end of the round"
